This is a Python 3 port for python-irclib 0.4.8.

This is different from existing libraries (
<https://github.com/farces/python-irclib>, 
<https://github.com/sixohsix/python-irclib/tree/py3>) in that it sends bytes
to socket instead of sending (Python 3) strings, eliminating encoding problems
it may cause when sending non-ascii characters.
